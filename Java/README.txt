
I am currently learning Java with full dedication, going beyond my university courses to strengthen my skills. I've completed the Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java course, Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization and Practical Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5.
I'm currently working on the Java Masterclass 2025: 130+ Hours of Expert Lessons.

My main Java project right now is PlaceMe (Uses TableManagementAlgorithm as a jar file), which Iâ€™m developing to enhance my understanding and practical skills.

I have also started the course:
"Master Spring 6, Spring Boot 3, REST, JPA & Hibernate"
to enhance and expand this project.

Soon, I plan to learn more about AWS and advanced SQL in order to further upgrade and scale the system.

This repository will continue to grow as I progress in my learning journey.
