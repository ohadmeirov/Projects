
I am currently learning Java with full dedication, going beyond my university courses to strengthen my skills. I've completed the Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java course, and I'm currently working on the Java Masterclass 2025: 130+ Hours of Expert Lessons.

My main Java project right now is the TableManagementAlgorithm, which Iâ€™m developing to enhance my understanding and practical skills.

Soon, I will be diving into courses like:

Learn Java Unit Testing with Junit & Mockito in 30 Steps

Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization

Master Spring 6, Spring Boot 3, REST, JPA, Hibernate

This repository will continue to grow as I progress in my learning journey.
